				<button type="button" class="Faq" >What is your service charge policy?</button>
				<div class="content">
				<p>Any optional service charge that you leave is a direct reward for the staff who made your experience special. 
				We therefore ensure that all service charge goes to the staff in the restaurant where it was given. 
				It is entirely your choice whether to pay the service charge. Please ask if you wish it to be removed.</p>
				</div>
				
				<button type="button" class="Faq">Do you cater for children at Westeros? </button>
				<div class="content">
				<p>We are pleased to welcome children in all of our restaurants, and offer an Enfants menu which can be viewed here. 
				All of our restaurants provide highchairs, and most will also have baby changing facilities.</p>
				</div>
				
				<button type="button" class="Faq">Are dogs allowed in the restaurant? </button>
				<div class="content">
				<p>As much as we would love to welcome all dogs into our restaurants unfortunately only guide and assistance dogs are allowed.

				</div>
				
				<button type="button" class="Faq">I am having problems booking an offer, that I have received on email. </button>
				<div class="content">
				<p>Sometimes security settings can prevent the browser from accessing the final page of the reservations process. 
				Try accessing the email on a different device or browser, perhaps try on a smartphone or a different computer if you have one. 
				If you are still not able to book you can forward the email and your desired booking details to the restaurant you would like to book and they can complete this for you.</p>
				</div>
			
				<button type="button" class="Faq">Do you provide offers or loyalty schemes? </button>
